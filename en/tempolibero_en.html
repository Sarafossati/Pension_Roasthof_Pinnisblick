        <h3>THE VALLEY</h3>
        <br>
        <p>It is not only the unique location and easy accessibility, close to Tyrol’s capital Innsbruck, that make the Stubai Valley perfect for a winter holiday. <br><strong>The amazing winter sport</strong> facilities on offer at the glacier that make it ideal. Responsible for these facilities are the <strong>four ski areas</strong> with hotspots for <strong>skiers</strong>, <strong>snowboarders</strong>, <strong>freeriders</strong> and <strong>toboggan enthusiasts</strong>.<br> Perfectly groomed slopes, the ‘BIG Family Stubai’ special offer for all age groups, additional services for the winter season such as tobogganing, cross-country skiing, winter hiking and snowshoe hiking trails and great snow conditions guaranteed from October to June; these things are as much a given for the Stubai natives as the excellent natural food and hospitality they propose.</p>
